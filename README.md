# OpenGL testing project
I probaly wont achieve anything with it but might get some cool features one day

# How to build 
> Note, I have only tested this on Windows x64 and Visual Studio 2022
* Install premake5 if you haven't already
* Clone the repository
* Open the folder in a termial
* Run premake5 [your editor, {check premake docs)]
* Application should be ready to use now, if not please make an issue

## Current progress
* Extremely wacky simple 2D renderer
* Simple shader class
* ImGui intergration
* Some classes to abstract some of the code
* Fps counter
* Input handler

# 3D rendering

## Stuff I want to implement
* Textures
* 3D rendering
* Camera controls
* Basic lighting
* Docking ImGui
* Model loading
* Some kind of physics

### Future
I'll be mainly testing and learning in this project
I hope to make a somewhat proper render engine/game engine later when im smart.
