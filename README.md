# OpenGL testing project
I probaly wont achieve anything with it but might get some cool features one day

## Current progress
* Extremely wacky simple 2D renderer
* Simple shader class
* ImGui intergration
* Some classes to abstract some of the code
* Fps counter
* Input handler

## Stuff I want to implement
* Textures
* 3D rendering
* Camera controls
* Basic lighting
* Docking ImGui
* Model loading
* Some kind of physics

### Future
I'll be mainly testing and learning in this project
I hope to make a somewhat proper render engine/game engine later when im smart.
