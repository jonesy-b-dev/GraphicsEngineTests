Here I experiment with OpenGL and im following the tutorials on Learnopengl.com

Next to those tutorials I hope to add some IMGUI to customise stuff at runtime .

This is nothing of a serious project and im just learning stuff here. 

Later I hope to make some actual little game engine with a game made it.
