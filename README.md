# OpenGL testing project
I probaly wont achieve anything with it but might get some cool features one day

# How to build 
> Note, I have only tested this on Windows x64 and Visual Studio 2022
* Install premake5 if you haven't already
* Clone the repository
* Open the folder in a termial
* Run `premake5 [your editor, {check premake docs}]`
* Application should be ready to use now, if not please make an issue

## Current progress
* Extremely simple 3D renderer
* Simple shader class
* Docking ImGui intergration
* Clip plane settings
* Fov setting
* Fps counter
* Simple input handler
* Resizable window
* Full 3D camera control
* Simple phong lighting

## Stuff I want to implement
* ✅Textures
* ✅Basic 3D rendering
* ✅Camera controls
* ✅Basic lighting
* ✅Docking ImGui
* Model loading
* Some kind of physics

### Future
I'll be mainly testing and learning in this project
[Stellar Engine](https://github.com/OuterCelestics/StellarEngine) is the engine I'm more actively developing
